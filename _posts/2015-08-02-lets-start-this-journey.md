  Ciao!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;m Mario and I&#8217;m going to start this new adventure thanks to <strong><a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Sonmez</a></strong>.<br /> I&#8217;ve been following his blog for a long time, but only a couple of weeks ago I&#8217;ve decided to subscribe to his free course &#8220;<a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/?__s=1asqmzoe3ehqikxswcfy&utm_campaign=lesson-5-do-you-know-how-to-get-traffic-for-your-blog&utm_medium=email&utm_source=how-to-create-a-blog-that-boosts-your-career-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How To Build A Blog That Will Boost Your Career</a>&#8220;.
</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="s1">I&#8217;ve never paused to properly think about how valuable it could be having a blog or works on something that&#8217;s simply yours. When I say &#8220;properly think&#8221; I mean consider finding hours to work on that, to get started, to forget about &#8220;perfection&#8221; and just jump into it. </span><span class="s1">And now…here we go!</span>
</p>

<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="s1"><em>Let’s be honest!</em> </span>
</h5>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="s1">There are hundreds of good tutorials on the web that explains to you how to easily create a blog, install WordPress and get started because, <em>apparently</em>, that is all that you need.</span>
</p>

<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  <strong><em><span class="s1">So why did I choose this course?</span></em></strong>
</h5>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="s1">As I said, I’ve never tried to create a blog, I’ve always thought would’ve been nice working on something that was mine, but I’ve never given the right priority to that. But then John, through his course, said:</span>
</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  <span class="s1">”<em>Hey man, I know you are busy, I know you think that you aren&#8217;t a great author, I know you prefer to invest your spare time on doing something else..but you know what&#8230; if you don&#8217;t try, you will always be one of the others! So let’s start, follow me and in 3 weeks you’ll have your blog up and running.</em>” </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Simply as that!</span>
</p>

<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  <em>In a nutshell: what is this course about?</em>
</h5>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  It&#8217;s a course focused on boosting your career thanks to your blog, on helping you find a better job, have a better salary&#8230;<strong>MAKE THE DIFFERENCE and <strong>be in the top 1% of all software developers</strong></strong>! It helps you find a theme that enhances your passions, know what to write about, get some traffic on it and keep it up. Moreover, it&#8217;s a specialized course, it&#8217;s for software engineers, so it will be easy find an answer to the questions you may have..And if you can&#8217;t find an answer, drop him an email and he will answer. I promise. At least, that&#8217;s what happened to me.
</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  That&#8217;s why, in my opinion, this tutorial is completely different from what you can find on the web. I really recommend you to subscribe and..let me know what you think about this course.

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  Cheers.
